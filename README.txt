Dicom2Volume (C# application/library) 

Loads DICOM files and extracts image data, orientation, positions, scale and metadata 
like WindowLevel. DICOM slices are sorted based on calculated SliceLocation and image 
and metadata is exported to XML, RAW and DDS (Direct Draw Surface - ideal for Direct3D 
loading). Optional tar.gz compression can also be applied. Ideal if you want the 
simplest way of working with volume medical data without the hassle of DICOM. Can be 
used as standalone application or as a library.
